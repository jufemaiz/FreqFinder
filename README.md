# FreqFinder

This repo is currently not supported properly. I've since used it as the basis
for the [port to react](https://github.com/jufemaiz/freq-finder-react). You

Not finding freaks but freqs - radio frequencies for when you're out and about.

Why? Because while Australia's ACMA publishes some things, a simple "what radio
is available near me?" response just doesn't exist! It was inspired when my
girlfriend called me wanting to know the TripleJ frequencies near her!

GeoCode base stations (not taking into account power...yet) against a location
and get going with options to listen to!
